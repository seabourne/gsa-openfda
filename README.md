# Seabourne/Metrostar Systems 18f Pool 2 Prototype

## Introduction

The goal of the Seabourne/Metrostar Pool 2 prototype is to visualize the relationship between different concepts in food safety enforcement actions.

Using a combination of APIs, natural language processing tools, data aggregations, and visualization libraries, this prototype demonstrates the feasibility and low level of effort necessary to use open source tools to better understand and represent the relationships between products, ingredients, contaminations and enforcement actions.
